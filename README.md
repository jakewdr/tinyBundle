# Why?

Tiny bundle is a bundler which compresses multiple python files into a single file!

This is similar to the [pyz](https://github.com/BTOdell/pyz) but doesn't require its own file type!

# How to use this?

Just git clone it and your good to go!

Your source code should go in the SRC folder with the __main__.py being the file that is initially ran by python.
