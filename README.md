# Why?

Tiny bundle is a bundler which compresses multiple python files into a single file!

This is similar to [pyz](https://github.com/BTOdell/pyz) and [zipfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html) but doesn't require its own file type.

Hence it acts more like javascript's [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)

# How to use this?

Just git clone it and your good to go.

Your source code should go in the SRC folder with the __main__.py being the file that is initially ran by python.

The bundle.py can be ran like any other python file or you can use the 'run' function in tinyBundle.py 

# What is example.py?

Example.py contains boilerplate for building your project.
